To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

sol:
git push origin **branch name** or git push --set-upstream origin feature/CA-13

sol:
git branch -r
git checkout to the origin branch that you want to work on, then
git branch to create a new branch to work on
git checkout to the new branch
