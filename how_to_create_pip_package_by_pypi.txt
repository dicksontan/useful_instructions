1.create an empty folder e.g. called base-folder
2. cd into that folder
3. create a folder (e.g. zdt) and put your python files inside
4. create a python file called setup.py. 
sample contents of setup.py (things to edit are like name, version, install_requires(this one have to ensure no standard python packages that are already installed by python e.g. os)):

from setuptools import setup, find_packages
import codecs
import os

VERSION = '2.0'
DESCRIPTION = 'zdt'

# Setting up
setup(
    name="zdt",
    version=VERSION,
    author="Dickson",
    author_email="<suwon2912@gmail.com>",
    description=DESCRIPTION,
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=['sqlalchemy', 'typing', 'hdbcli','redmail','pandas>=1.1','datetime','python-dateutil','numpy'],
    keywords=['python', 'video', 'stream', 'video stream', 'camera stream', 'sockets'],
    classifiers=[
        "Development Status :: 1 - Planning",
        "Intended Audience :: Developers",
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "Operating System :: Unix",
        "Operating System :: MacOS :: MacOS X",
        "Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows",
    ]
)

5. go to dist folder and clear files from prev versions

6. run this command in command primpt to create wheel and eggs files(make sure to have wheel, setuptools, latest version of pip, ez_setup):
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

7. run this command to upload to pypi (make sure you hae twine):

twine upload dist/*

username: __token__

password (ctrl c and ctrl v in) = pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcCJDFkZDVhNzBhLWNkMTYtNDc3ZC1iODRjLWJkOWFmNThhOGZkMgACKlszLCI5ZmNjY2ZkYy03NTg2LTQ5ZmQtODgwOC0xYTliMmY4ZmQ4N2EiXQAABiARmrgUZmU3a95_pMBlWWo06FMYs3W5qC2IS5BDZAHWzQ
